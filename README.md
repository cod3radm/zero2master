Learn to code in 2018 and have fun along the way
For the next 5 months I'll be focusing on the most employable and in demand skills in 2018

First Month: The Big Picture (April)
  01. Understand the Feynman Technique (basically learn new things and explain it simply the way a child would understand, take notes and write down the things that you don't know about the subject you're trying to learn)
  02. How does the internet work from their youtube channel codeacademy and thenewboston (short videos that shows how the browser connects to ISP and remote servers to reach any sites; a way to share resources locally [LAN] and [WAN])
  03. An overview of Computer Science (the beginning stages of computing from 1700s until now - about 12 videos on Crash Course of CS)
  04. Ultimate instructor of Harvard course on youtube (an hour lecture on CS)

  06. How to build/get domain/ and ftp to host by youtube channel codeacademy
  07. How does HTML/CSS/JS fit together by FrontEndmasters course (subscription required)
  8.  Learn to build websites with Bootstrap (at this point Bootstrap 4 in order to understand the benefits it provides vs writing CSS)
