How does the Internet work? How would you answer that question? Most of the people using their computers to browse the net doesn't have a clue... for the most part. They only know to turn on their computer and open the browser and begin navigating (browse) the sites.

As a Web Developer we need to be familiar with what the browser does to access the internet
1.  PC/Browser(92.84.143.240) is making a request to a Remote Server(e.g. 63.41.23.122) and the Server is response to the request
    a. Any device(pc, laptop, phone, tablet) that connects to the internet has an IP Address
    b. If you type on your browser take me to www.mysite.com, your ISP does DNSlookup which translate the name to an IP Address
    c. Your PC connects to the Server and provides the files for that site (www.mysite.com)
        i. index.html (content-type) text/html [request]
    d. The browser starts to parse the file from top to bottom and stops if it finds an asset 
        i. main.css, js, img) text/css [request]
    e. Loads the site quicker
        i. CSS should load first in the <head> element
       ii. Scripts could be place at the bottom of your index.html before </body> element
