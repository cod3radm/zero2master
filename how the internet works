How does the Internet work? How would you answer that question? Most of the people using their computers to browse the net doesn't have a clue... for the most part. They only know to turn on their computer and open the browser and begin navigating (browse) the sites.

As a Web Developer we need to be familiar with what the browser does to access the internet
1.  PC/Browser(92.84.143.240) is making a request to a Remote Server(e.g. 63.41.23.122) and the Server is response to the request
    a. Any device(pc, laptop, phone, tablet) that connects to the internet has an IP Address
    b. If you type on your browser take me to www.mysite.com, your ISP does DNSlookup which translate the name to an IP Address
    c. Your PC connects to the Server and provides the files for that site (www.mysite.com)
        i. index.html (content-type) text/html [request]
    d. The browser starts to parse the file from top to bottom and stops if it finds an asset 
        i. main.css text/css [request]
            * js, img [request]
    e. Loads the site quicker
        i. CSS should load first in the <head> element
       ii. Scripts could be place at the bottom of your index.html before </body> element
      iii. Concatenate all the scripts files into 1 file to avoid many requests to the Server (Minify script files)
       iv. xhr request - is an API in the form of an object whose methods transfer data between a web browser and a web server
    f. Request - may contain headers and post body
        i. Open Chrome Developer tools and open the Network tab
            * Request headers > host: www.google.com
                                method: GET / POST (email)
                                path: /
                                cookie: PREF=ID=eca0a52b23... (cookies are stored in your computer)
            * Response headers > content-type: text/html
                                 status: 200 OK (300 redirected, 400 error, 500 server broken) - JavaScript status
            * Google Homepage Request > method: GET / POST (login) / PUT (edit) / DELETE
                                        user-agent: BACK-END will identify what kind of device
                                        method: POST
                                        path: login
                                        content-type: application/json
                                        request body: (username: kittyme)
                                        password: myPaw2jump!
                             Response > status: 200 ok
                                        content-type: application/json
                                        response-body: {username
                                                       permission
                                                       postCount
                                                       lastLoggedOn
                                                       userID }
