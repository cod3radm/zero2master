The Internet Service Provider does DNS lookup, and translate the TLD to an IP Address.
1.  Browser(10.1.1.1) sometimes they're call Clients making a request to Server(e.g. 63.41.23.122) and the Server is going to post responses. The Server is 100% responsible for those responses. (e.g. request google.com and google server response with an image)

                * FILESYSTEM (sites/mysite.com/www folder)
                    * index.html or index.php
                    * about.html
                    * contact.html
